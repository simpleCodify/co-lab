<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![co-Lab Home Screenshot][home-screenshot]


co-Lab is a platform where Users around the world can come together to collaborate on a project. Whether you're a back-end developer, full-stack engineer, database engineer, UI/UX Designer, React developer, or a software engineer that excels in algorithms, you could be lacking in a specific aspect of developing a Project from concept to realization.

That's where co-Lab comes in!

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on working on something you specialize in and enjoy!
* You don't have to spend hours upon hours trying to figure out how to implement a noSQL database, when you have no need of that knowledge elsewhere.
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Current version of co-Lab supports back-end, front-end developer roles, and UI/UX designer role, but more will be implemented in the future to support a wider variety of users!

In the near future, I will be adding the functionality of categorically arranging projects, with a structured architecture.

Also, the possibilities of adding fields outside of Software engineering, such as Music, Photography, Cinematography.
